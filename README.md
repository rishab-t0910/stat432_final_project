# stat432_final_project
This is my group project for STAT 432 - Basics of Statistical Learning at UIUC. The goal is to construct 2 classification models and 2 regression models on a World Health Organization (WHO) dataset to determine Life Expectancy. I will be working on the Logistic Regression (Classification) and Random Forest (Regression) model, while my group mate does Linear Regression and K-nearest neighbours. 

Should be fun!
