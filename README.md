# STAT 432 Final Project Readme.md
This is my group project for STAT 432 - Basics of Statistical Learning at UIUC. The goal is to construct 2 classification models and 2 regression models on a World Health Organization (WHO) dataset to determine Life Expectancy. I will be working on the Logistic Regression (Classification) and Random Forest (Regression) model, while my group mate does Linear Regression and K-nearest neighbours. 

Should be fun!

Created the Github repo with the files. Finished the initial logistic regression portion. I have found some variables of interest based on correlation analysis, and conducted my regression. We find a relatively low classification error ~ 0.25, but this also means 1 in 4 classifications is wrong. This is something I need to fix in the future. 

Plan -
1. Better the error for the model
    a. This could be changing the inputs, scaling, creating multiple classes for life expectancy
2. Calculate sensitivity and specificity
